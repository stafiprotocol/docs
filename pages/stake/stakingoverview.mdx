# Overview

Liquid staking is a way to allow users to stake their token and earn rewards while still having access to their assets. Traditional staking locks up users' assets, making them inaccessible. Liquid staking allows users to keep using their assets by staking them to a protocol using smart contracts and converting their staked assets into liquid tokens.

Liquid staking has the following benefits:
- Users can earn staking rewards while still having access to their assets.
- Users can participate in DeFi protocols using liquid tokens.
- Users can reduce their staking risk.

## Staking with StaFi

## Function

The StaFi rToken app offers three key functionalities, enhancing the user experience:
- **Stake and Unstake**: Users can easily stake and unstake their assets using the app. This allows them to participate in the staking process and earn rewards, while retaining the flexibility to withdraw their funds when needed.
- **Pool**: The app provides an opportunity to utilize rToken for participating in StaFi and DeFi liquidity mining. By leveraging rToken, users can not only earn staking rewards but also benefit from additional FIS token rewards. This dual-earning potential enhances the overall profitability of their participation.
- **Bridge**: The app enables the bridging of rTokens to various chains. For instance, users can bridge rETH to layer2 solutions, which offer lower gas fees. This functionality allows users to participate in on-chain activities with reduced costs, thus enhancing accessibility and optimizing their engagement.

## Liquidity Mining

Liquidity mining is a program that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to the StaFi protocol. By providing liquidity, users can earn rewards in the form of StaFi tokens (FIS). The program is designed to encourage users to contribute to the liquidity of the rETH, which is essential for its success.

### Mint Program

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

The Mint Program is a staking incentive program that rewards users for staking their tokens in StaFi and minting new rTokens.

<Callout>
The majority of FIS rewards from the Mint Program are typically on the StaFi Chain. Therefore, to claim rewards, you'll need to create an account and wallet on the StaFi Chain. FIS can then be traded on Uniswap via Ethereum by using a CEX or bridge. For further details on FIS-related operations, please refer to [FIS token](/fistoken).
</Callout>

When users stake their tokens in StaFi, they receive rTokens, which represent their staked tokens. They also receive FIS rewards, which are paid out in proportion to their stake.

Guides:
- Click the following link to enter the [Pool page](https://app.stafi.io/pool/all). This guide takes the rETH pool as an example to demonstrate the main functions.
- Click "Mint" to stake ETH, the page will jump to ETH staking page, then stake ETH as the page prompt.
- After the staking is completed, the page will be displayed on the details page. Then click "Claim" to claim FIS rewards.

There is also another type of rToken program, which is called Liquidity Mining. In Liquidity Mining, users stake their rTokens to a liquidity mining contract. Their rTokens are locked, and they will receive FIS rewards in return.

The Mint Program and rToken Liquidity Mining are both designed to incentivize users to stake their tokens in StaFi and earn rewards. By staking their tokens, users can earn both rTokens and FIS rewards.

Guides:
- Click the following link to enter the [Pool page](https://app.stafi.io/pool/all). This guide takes the rETH pool as an example to demonstrate the main functions.
- Click "Deposit" to stake rETH, and wait for claim FIS rewards.

### DeFi Integration

rETH Liquidity Mining Pools enable users to add their rETH to contribute to the rETH liquidity while earning additional yield from their staked tokens. With StaFi's rETH, participants can stake their ETH and rETH in these pools and in return, receive rewards depending on the pool they are on. Rewards are generated from the trading fee’s that occur from swaps as well as further incentivizations from StaFi and 3rd party protocols.

## Wallet Connect

WalletConnect is an open-source, decentralized Web3 protocol for connecting blockchain wallets to decentralized applications (DApps). It allows users to easily and securely connect their wallets to DApps without having to enter their private keys or other sensitive information.

To use WalletConnect, users simply need to scan a QR code or click a link generated by the DApp. This will open a connection between the DApp and the user's wallet. Once the connection is established, the user can then interact with the DApp, such as sending transactions, signing contracts, or viewing their account balance.

WalletConnect is a secure and convenient way for users to connect their wallets to DApps. It is widely supported by a variety of wallets, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.
