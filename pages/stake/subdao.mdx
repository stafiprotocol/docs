StaFi is entering a transformative phase with the launch of StaFi LSaaS 2.0, marking a significant update to its Liquid Staking as a Service (LSaaS) framework. This update comes as the rToken migration on StaFi Chain and the execution of StaFi Hub migration progress towards completion, setting the stage for the highly anticipated StaFi Revamp Wave.

## Accelerating LSaaS Adoption

With StaFi LSaaS now fully developed, the focus has shifted to adoption. The team has launched grants and pitched the service to numerous partners, aiming to drive wider usage. However, despite these efforts, both the StaFi team and community believe the growth needs to accelerate.

## Introducing SubDAOs

As part of the rebrand, StaFi DAO will introduce SubDAOs, a groundbreaking move that will foster decentralization and innovation. Each SubDAO will function as an independent Liquid Staking Token (LST) protocol with its own token, empowering developers and communities to create tailored staking solutions while maintaining the integrity of the StaFi ecosystem.

To enhance adoption and scalability, StaFi will leverage SubDAOs to build new LST protocols using LSaaS. These SubDAOs will not only introduce fresh innovations but will also operate with independent tokens, ensuring each entity can evolve according to its specific community’s needs while remaining aligned with the broader StaFi ecosystem.

All SubDAO LST protocols will be built entirely upon StaFi LSaaS’s rich components and tools. SubDAOs will become the best representatives and use cases for LSaaS, while simultaneously, LSaaS will announce significant updates that will be revealed soon.

## StaFi DAO’s Stake in Sub DAOs and Value Distribution to FIS Holders

To further integrate SubDAOs within the StaFi DAO ecosystem, StaFi DAO will maintain a strategic allocation of each SubDAO’s tokens, reinforcing alignment between new LST protocols and the broader StaFi framework. This approach creates a unified decentralized ecosystem while preserving the innovative autonomy of individual protocols.

Importantly, each SubDAO will contribute a designated percentage of its tokens to the StaFi DAO Treasury. This structured mechanism will significantly enhance the value proposition of the entire StaFi ecosystem and, by extension, increase the intrinsic value held by FIS token holders. Rather than simple airdrops, StaFi DAO is committed to creating sustainable value flow back to FIS holders, with specific details on value distribution mechanisms and potential SubDAO tokens allocation formats to be announced in forthcoming communications.

This value accrual model creates a virtuous cycle where the success of each SubDAO directly contributes to the overall StaFi ecosystem strength and the value proposition for every FIS holder.

A comprehensive update regarding the StaFi DAO Treasury portfolio, including detailed allocations of SubDAO tokens and projected value impact assessments, will be published in upcoming announcements. This transparent approach ensures all stakeholders can clearly understand how the SubDAO integration contributes to the collective growth and sustainability of the StaFi ecosystem.
