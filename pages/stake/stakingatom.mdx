## rATOM Migration

The rATOM token has been relaunched on Neutron, and its liquidity will also be managed on Neutron. With StaFi Hub scheduled to be decommissioned, users will need to migrate their rATOM tokens from StaFi Hub to Neutron. For detailed migration instructions, please refer to the information shared on [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/0xBABf7e6b5bcE0BD749FD3C527374bEf8919cC7A9/LLgygQd55Niz3htde7yIaBQ1_5I3XU9_igwOD0CBtQ4).

**Staked ATOM:** The ATOM staked in Cosmos Hub.

**LSM ATOM:** The ATOM that are transferred into tokenized delegations, the liquid staking process is initiated with the Liquid Staking Module tokenizing existing staked ATOM delegations and converting them into NFTs (tokenized delegations) with attributes like reward address, validator, etc.
