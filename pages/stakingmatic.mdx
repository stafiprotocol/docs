## The rMATIC Token

The following are the addresses where rMATIC has been issued on different chains:

- Polygon: [0x9f28e2455f9ffcfac9ebd6084853417362bc5dbb](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x9f28e2455f9ffcfac9ebd6084853417362bc5dbb)
- Ethereum: [0x3dbb00c9be5a327e25caf4f650844c5dba81e34b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3dbb00c9be5a327e25caf4f650844c5dba81e34b)

Additionally, rMATIC holders can participate in liquidity mining. To learn more about this opportunity, please [visit this page](https://app.stafi.io/rpool?program=lp).

## Commission Fee

The commission fee includes a 0.2% redemption fee for when rMATIC is unstaked, and 10% of staking rewards. All of these fees will be allocated to the StaFi DAO.

## Unstake

<Callout type="info">
The rMATIC token has been updated to the EVM LSD architecture, allowing for unstaking directly on Ethereum without the need to bridge to the StaFi Chain.
