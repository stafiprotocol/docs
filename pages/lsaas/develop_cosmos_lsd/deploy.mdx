title: How to deploy Cosmos LSD stack
---

This guide provides a step-by-step script to deploy the Cosmos LSD stack, without knowing details about contracts and services. Read the documentation for comprehensive understandings of these components.

## Neutron(ICS-27) LSD Stack

### Step1. Run IBC Relay

The goal of the first step is to have a connection identifier between target chain and Neutron, e.g. `connection-0`. We can browse current mainnet [Neutron Relayers](https://www.mintscan.io/neutron/relayers). If the IBC is already exist we can retrieve its connection id from [Cosmos Chain Registry Repository](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/_IBC). But if it doesn't we need run IBC Relayer by following the doc: [Neutron Run IBC Relayer](https://docs.neutron.org/relaying/ibc-relayer).

### Step2. Deploy your LSD network contracts

61 Lab have made [StaFi LSAAS](https://stack-app.stafi.io/) for project parties to deploy their LSD network contracts.

### Neutron Risks Awareness

Our Stack, designed for the ICS-27 protocol, utilizes Neutron—first Cosmos chain adopting [Replicated Security](https://cosmos.github.io/interchain-security/). As a smart contract platform, like Ethereum which still encounters security issues, Neutron may also face potential security risks. We advise every project party to conduct thorough research and assess these risks before participation.

#### Parameter Tips

Connection ID:
- Connection identifier of target chain and Neutron

Interchain Account ID:
- An identifier of your pool
- Must be unique
- Max 16 characters
- Not contains Hyphen(-) or Dot(.)

Owner Address:
- Adjust commission fee
- Adjust duration of era
- Manage validator set
- Pause or unpause pool
- Turn on or off LSM feature

Fee Receiver
- A neutron address to receive LSD commission fee

Fee commission:
- 10% is an reasonable price for most stakers

Minimum Stake:
- The smallest amount of assets accept in staking procedure

LSD Token Code ID:
- A cw20-base compatible smart contract
- Recommend to keep default
- Able to use your own Code ID

Validators:
- Pool will delegate assets evenly to every validator
- Target chain validator address


#### Pool registration fee

Registration fee is required by Neutron to register an interchain account.

### Pool initialization fee

To prevent malicious or buggy contracts from draining relayer's funds or spamming of the network, Neutron introduces FeeRefunder module similar to [ICS-29](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-029-fee-payment) but supports wider range of chains. Get a comprehensive view here: [Neutron Fee Refunder Module Documentation](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/feerefunder/overview).

#### Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to project parties. Commission fee of users is set default as 10% and StaFi Stack fee is 10% of project income. for example, if `100ATOM` rewards received from Cosmos, the distribution will be:

| Role | Amount | Formula |
|---------------|--------|-------|
|  Users        |  90ATOM | 100ATOM*(1-0.1)  |
|  Project      |  9ATOM  | (100ATOM-90ATOM)*(1-0.1)  |
|  StaFi Stack  |  1ATOM  | 100ATOM-90ATOM-9ATOM  |

#### Re-edit parameters

Project parties can use admin account to update parameters by sending transactions to `StakeManager.config_pool` method with below message:

| Fields | Description |
|---------------|--------|
| pool_addr        |  your pool address <br/> **required** |
| platform_fee_receiver | a Neutron address to receive commission fee <br/> optional|
| minimal_stake | minimum amount of token to stake <br/> optional |
| unstake_times_limit | how many times a staker can unstake <br/> optional|
| unbond_commission | commission fee of unbonding <br/> optional|
| platform_fee_commission | commission fee of rewards <br/> optional|
| era_seconds | how long an era last <br/> optional|
| paused | is pool active or paused <br/> optional|
| lsm_support | does pool support LSM stake <br/> optional|
| lsm_pending_limit | how man LSM stake support in pending status <br/> optional|
| rate_change_limit | the limit for exchange rate changes from Token to rToken <br/ >optional|
| new_admin | transfer admin role to new address <br/> optional|

### Step3. Run ICQ relay service
<a href="../icq_relay/" target="_blank">Follow our doc to run ICQ relay service</a>

### Step4. Run LSD relay service

#### Install Build Tools

Install `make`, `gcc` and `git`

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make gcc git build-essential
```

Install `go` by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to set your `$PATH` environment variable, for example:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget -O go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GO111MODULE=on' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc && . $HOME/.bashrc
go version
```

#### Install relay service

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stafiprotocol/neutron-lsd-relay.git
$ cd neutron-lsd-relay
$ make install
```

#### Create relay working directory and config file

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/cosmos-neutron-stack
$ cp config.template.toml ~/cosmos-neutron-stack/config.toml
```

#### Config neutron relay service

Update config (config.toml) by your favorite editor according to [Relay Config](./relay.html#config)

```toml
endpointList = ["http://127.0.0.1:26657"]
gasPrice = "0.005untrn"
taskTicker = 60  # seconds
poolAddr = "cosmos1hvuhdvwnsuj487xdcsv4yntn3hlxsmlmp602z4jkq95c20fsp3cshuzjhg"
stakeManager = "neutron1rjr282qjnaeamsps4aspw8gmz4nynjpq6zurxfnppdcknpwdnxgs8rqm8y"
runForEntrustedPool = false

keyringDir = "/home/<your_user_name>/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring"
keyringBackend = "file"
keyName = "demowallet1"
```

#### Add or Import account

You can simply create a new account to submit transactions on neutron

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay keys add stafi-relay-1 \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):

- address: neutron1c4ceejzxucas3sp5nvum4f8kr7pdun6wdw3y06
  name: stafi-relay-1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Au3RxMxljL7CagnKcN/4j63KPRJjuCYhseeimwLVK9/3"}'
  type: local


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

youth stairs bronze tree melt coast grass table help lock road gospel quote explain usage retreat present now tragic course balance easy curtain this
```

Or you can import an exist account, let's say you have just exported from `neutrond` via `neutrond keys --home=$HOME_1 --keyring-backend=test export demowallet1  > demowallet1.privatekey`, you can import it to relay:

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay keys import demowallet1 demowallet1.privatekey \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter passphrase to decrypt your key:
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
Re-enter keyring passphrase:

$ neutron-lsd-relay keys list \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
- address: neutron1m9l358xunhhwds0568za49mzhvuxx9ux8xafx2
  name: demowallet1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A/MdHVpitzHNSdD1Zw3kY+L5PEIPyd9l6sD5i4aIfXp9"}'
  type: local
```

⚠️Please make sure the account have enough NEUTRON funds, since relay will send transaction to StakeManager contract.

#### Start relay services

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay start --base-path=~/cosmos-neutron-stack
config path: /home/ubuntu/cosmos-neutron-stack/config.toml
load config success

### Step5. Deploy your own LSD App
<a href="app.html" target="_blank">Follow our doc to deploy your own LSD App</a>

### Optional Steps: Enable Cross-Chain Token Transfers

After deploying your Cosmos LSD stack, you might want to enable cross-chain transfers for your LSD tokens. This allows users to transfer tokens between Neutron and other IBC-enabled chains.

To set up cross-chain token transfers:
1. Check out our [Neutron Token ICS20 guide](../modules/neutron_token_ics20) for detailed instructions
2. Learn how to deploy the CW20-ICS20 contract
3. Run and config your own IBC Relayers with channels and your token in allowlists
4. Enable secure cross-chain token transfers for your LSD tokens
