title: Relay of Cosmos LSD Stack 
---

Given the limitation of smart contracts, they are not self-executing, and require an external force to trigger their functions. Relay is a service to drive LSD to properly process its own internal states, such as dealing with delegating, undelegating, distributing rewards and calculating the rate between LST and the original coin. We introduce `era` concept to define how often the smart contract should be called. Most of the time, an era is 24 hours long.

*Security* is the our first priority when developing Stack, We are thrilled to say that the new era process is permissionless, showcasing the decentralized nature of the Cosmos LSD Stack, allowing anyone to trigger the beginning of a new era. Each step in the process includes sufficient condition checks to prevent the contract from re-processing transactions or prematurely moving to subsequent steps. The new era process will be triggered when a pool meets the conditions for starting a new era (i.e., reaching the time to start the next era).

The relay solution for chains only support ICS-27 protocol differs from those support Native CosmWasm, therefore we provide two proper relay types.

## Neutron(ICS-27) LSD Relay

### Relay methods

#### era_update
Transfer the tokens at an era on the neutron chain to the account on the original chain through ICA and interchain transactions.

#### era_stake
Handles staking, unstaking, and withdrawal transactions on the original chain.

#### era_withdraw_collect
Collects rewards from the previous era into the pool ICA account in preparation for restake.

#### era_restake
Restake rewards generated in the previous era.

#### era_active
Handles the data changes caused by new stakes or unstakes in the new era process, calculates the new era's rate, and initiates the new era.

#### redeem_token_for_share
The delegations are not transfered to pool ica account immediately when user stake LSM. We call this mehtod to redeem the delegations.

### Install Build Tools

Install `make`, `gcc` and `git`

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make gcc git build-essential
```

Install `go` by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to set your `$PATH` environment variable, for example:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget -O go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GO111MODULE=on' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc && . $HOME/.bashrc
go version
```

### Install relay service

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stafiprotocol/neutron-lsd-relay.git
$ cd neutron-lsd-relay
$ make install
```

### Create relay working directory and config file

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/cosmos-neutron-stack
$ cp config.template.toml ~/cosmos-neutron-stack/config.toml
```

### Config neutron relay service

Update config (config.toml) by your favorite editor according to [Relay Config](./relay.html#config)

```toml
endpointList = ["http://127.0.0.1:26657"]
gasPrice = "0.005untrn"
taskTicker = 60  # seconds
poolAddr = "cosmos1hvuhdvwnsuj487xdcsv4yntn3hlxsmlmp602z4jkq95c20fsp3cshuzjhg"
stakeManager = "neutron1rjr282qjnaeamsps4aspw8gmz4nynjpq6zurxfnppdcknpwdnxgs8rqm8y"
runForEntrustedPool = false

keyringDir = "/home/<your_user_name>/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring"
keyringBackend = "file"
keyName = "demowallet1"
```

### Add or Import account

You can simply create a new account to submit transactions on neutron

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay keys add stafi-relay-1 \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):

- address: neutron1c4ceejzxucas3sp5nvum4f8kr7pdun6wdw3y06
  name: stafi-relay-1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Au3RxMxljL7CagnKcN/4j63KPRJjuCYhseeimwLVK9/3"}'
  type: local


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

```

Or you can import an exist account, let's say you have just exported from `neutrond` via `neutrond keys --home=$HOME_1 --keyring-backend=test export demowallet1  > demowallet1.privatekey`, you can import it to relay:

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay keys import demowallet1 demowallet1.privatekey \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter passphrase to decrypt your key:
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
Re-enter keyring passphrase:

$ neutron-lsd-relay keys list \
    --keyring-backend=file --keyring-dir=~/cosmos-neutron-stack/keyring
Enter keyring passphrase (attempt 1/3):
- address: neutron1m9l358xunhhwds0568za49mzhvuxx9ux8xafx2
  name: demowallet1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A/MdHVpitzHNSdD1Zw3kY+L5PEIPyd9l6sD5i4aIfXp9"}'
  type: local
```

⚠️Please make sure the account have enough NEUTRON funds, since relay will send transaction to StakeManager contract.

### Start relay services

```bash
$ neutron-lsd-relay start --base-path=~/cosmos-neutron-stack
config path: /home/ubuntu/cosmos-neutron-stack/config.toml
load config success
