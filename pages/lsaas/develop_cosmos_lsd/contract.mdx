## Neutron Contracts

Smart contract is the core component of Cosmos LSD Stack, and comprised of two contracts: [StakeManager](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/neutron-lsd-contracts/tree/main/contracts/stake_manager) and [LSD token](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/neutron-lsd-contracts/tree/main/contracts/lsd_token). Among them, `StakeManager` takes responsible for handling staking logic, validator set management, reward distribution, and withdrawals, and `Lsd token` is a [cw20_base](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw20-base) compatible contract, users get after stake and will be burnt after unstake.

### StakeManager

StakeManager contract holds all LSD functionalities, it consists with many pools, each pool represents a individual project party associated with an admin account who is privileged to config pool's parameters.

#### Project party
- `register_pool`: Create pool ICA and withdraw ICA, and bind interchain routes e.g. channel, port
- `init_pool`: Pool should be initiated with validator set, fee receiver, commission rate and lsd token info
- `config_pool`: Update pool configs such as lsm_support, era_seconds, commission fee, fee receiver etc.
- `add_pool_validators`: Adds validators to the pool
- `rm_pool_validator`: Removes validator from the pool.
- `pool_update_validator`: Updates validator information for the pool.

#### User
- `stake`:
  - Attached with wasm invocation, users can stake token and get LSD token from source chain by ibc transfer function 
  - Users can call smart contract directly in neutron chain to stake
- `stake_lsm`: Users can stake their LSM to get LSD token avoiding 21 days unbonding period
- `unstake`: Anyone who owns LSD token can call this function, LSD token will be burnt and users have to wait unbonding period of time to withdraw their assets
- `withdraw`: When unstake become mature, users can withdraw

#### Stack

StaFi DAO can config stack parameters:
- default LSD token code id
- administrator address of stack
- entrusted pools: It is a great feature for project party who can rapidly run a LSD token without running its own relay service, StaFi DAO will run it instead. It is fully secure as all functions a relay needs to execute are permissionless.

#### Token Redemption 

`redeem_token_for_share`: This is a permissionless method that is called in real-time via relay to redeem stake_lsm's LST back to the original chain in exchange for corresponding shares.

#### New Era Process

- **Characteristics**: The new era process is permissionless, showcasing the decentralized nature of the Cosmos LSD Stack, allowing anyone to trigger the beginning of a new era. Each step in the process includes sufficient condition checks to prevent the contract from re-processing transactions or prematurely moving to subsequent steps.
- **Conditions**: The new era process can be triggered when a pool meets the conditions for starting a new era (i.e., reaching the time to start the next era).
- **Processes and Functions**:
    - `era_update`: Transfers an era's stored tokens on the neutron chain to an account on the original chain through ICA and interchain transactions.
    - `era_stake`: Handles staking, unstaking, and withdrawal transactions on the original chain.
    - `era_withdraw_collect`: Collects rewards from the previous era into the pool ICA account in preparation for restake.
    - `era_restake`: Restake rewards generated in the previous era.
    - `era_active`: Handles the data changes caused by new stakes or unstakes in the new era process, calculates the new era's rate, and initiates the new era.
- **ICQ Query Frequency Adjustment**: During the new era process, the contract will flexibly update the frequency of ICQ queries as needed to reduce the cost for ICQ relayers.
- When a Redelegate action occurs, `pool_update_validators_icq` must be executed to synchronize the contract content's ICQ with the latest validator-related queries.
