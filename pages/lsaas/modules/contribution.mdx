This page describes a general approach on how to write a new module and to share it with the community.

## Before you start

Follow these steps to implement a new module:
1. Read the architecture and develop documentation to get a comprehensive understanding
1. Dive into smart contracts:
    - [BTC LSD Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/babylon-lsd-contracts)
    - [ETH LSD Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/eth-lsd-contracts)
    - [Solana LSD Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lsd-contracts)
    - [ETH LRT Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/lrd-contracts)
    - [EVM LSD Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/evm-lsd-contracts)
    - [Cosmos LSD Contracts](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/neutron-lsd-contracts)
1. Implement the logic
1. Contact StaFi team if you have any questions 
1. Write documentation 

## Share your module


StaFi team have made it easy for every community member to participate in contribution. You are encouraged to share your module with a pull request to [LSD Stack App](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/lsd-stack-app). You should prepare these information:
1. Name of your module
1. A short description 
1. Resources about the module 
1. Documentation link

Below is an example pull request. 

```diff
# filename: interfaces/common.ts
export enum ModuleType {
+  Ccip = 'ccip',
}
```

```diff
# filename: config/modular/index.ts

export const modularConfigs = {
  externalModules: [
+    {
+      type: ModuleType.Ccip,
+      title: 'Chainlink CCIP',
+      description:
+        'By seamlessly integrating Chainlink&lsquo;s robust and secure CCIP functions, this module empowers developers to build and operate dApps with cross-chain capabilities.',
+      externalLink: 'https://chain.link/cross-chain',
+      tutorialLink:
+        'https://docs.stafi.io/lsaas/modules/ccip_modules',
+    },
  ],
  supportList: [
    [AppEco.Eth]: [
+      ModuleType.Ccip,
    ],
  ]
}
```
