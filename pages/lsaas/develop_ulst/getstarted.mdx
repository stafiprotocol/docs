# Get Started

ULST (USD Liquid Staking Token) Stack is devoted to help developers building liquid staking projects that integrate with Real World Assets (RWA) through Ondo Finance, and designed to provide a comprehensive set of solutions related to stablecoin deposits, RWA yield generation, and user operations: stake, unstake, withdraw.

## Contracts

Through the contracts provided by StaFi, project parties can create their ULST network contracts. These contracts are not only essential for a ULST project that records all the states of the project, such as: exchange rates between LSD and stablecoins, RWA token balances, and protocol fees etc, but also the dependence of Relay service and ULST dApp.

## ULST Relay Service

After creating the contracts, you'll need to deploy the relay service. The relay service operates off-chain and requires these addresses to work properly.

It provides functionality to manage era progression and coordinate with Ondo Finance for RWA operations. It triggers the smart contract to handle new era process: delegate stablecoins to RWA tokens, undelegate RWA tokens to stablecoins, and update exchange rates based on RWA performance.

## ULST dApp

Once the ULST contracts created, you can deploy the ULST dApp for users to stake stablecoins, unstake LSD tokens, withdraw funds and get the latest information about the project and RWA performance.
