# How to deploy an ULST stack

This guide provides a step-by-step script to deploy an ULST project, without deep understanding of contracts and services. Read the documentation for comprehensive understandings of these components.

## Step1. Deploy your LSD network contracts

61 Lab have made [StaFi LSaaS](https://stack-app.stafi.io/) for project parties to deploy their LSD network contracts. Click ULST icon to deploy your ULST network.

## Parameter Tips

Owner Address: sets the owner of the LSD network being created.

Owner Permissions:
- Upgrade contracts
- Adjust commission fee
- Adjust duration of era
- Pause or unpause unstake operation
- Manage stablecoins

Stable Coins: Stablecoins the network will support. You can add or remove stablecoin via StakeManager contract later with Owner permission.

- USDC
- PYUSD

## Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to project parties. Commission fee of users is set default as 10% and StaFi Stack fee is 10% of the project income. for example, if `100Token` rewards received from the chain, the distribution will be:

| Role | Amount(Token) | Formula |
|---------------|--------|-------|
|  Users        |  90 | 100*(1-0.1)  |
|  Project      |  9  | (100-90)*(1-0.1)  |
|  StaFi Stack  |  1  | 100-90-9  |

## Save all the information generated

The LSD network has a set of smart contracts, so you should save all the information which you will interact frequently with, such as LSD App, and Relay service.

- LSD Network Factory address
- Owner address
- LSD Token address
- Stake Manager address
- Stake Pool address

## Step2. Run relay service
[Follow this doc to run relay service](./relay/)

## Step3. Deploy your own LSD App
[Follow this doc to deploy your own LSD App](./app/)
