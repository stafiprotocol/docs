title: ETH LSD App
---

ETH LSD App is a user interface where users can stake, unstake and get latest information about the project. As a convention in web3 all API users interact with are directly from the RPC configured in wallet, so the app is a pure DApp.

## Build your own LSD App

### Setup Node.js env

1. Fork [code on GitHub](https://github.com/stafiprotocol/eth-lsd-app)
1. Install [Node.js >=v16](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
1. Install yarn via npm: `npm install --global yarn`
1. Enter project root directory then install all dependencies via terminal: `yarn`
1. Start app by: `yarn dev`

### Configure your app

> In normal case you do not need update ABI files, but if you modify the contracts then you probably want to update abi files which are in `config/abi` folder.

- Change branding links and text here: `config/appConf/app.json`

Slashing events, caused by disconnection or malicious behavior of validator nodes, could potentially reduce rewards; however, StaFi mitigates this risk by diversifying the staking funds across multiple validators with clean records and requiring them to provide additional deposits as collaterals. The staking reward claim status and the timing of claims on the original chain can also affect staking rewards.\n"
