title: How to deploy Solana LSD stack
---

This guide provides a step-by-step script to deploy the Solana LSD stack, without knowing details about contracts and services. Read the documentation for comprehensive understandings of these components.


## Step1. Deploy your LSD network contracts

61 Lab have made [StaFi LSAAS](https://stack-app.stafi.io/) for project parties to deploy their LSD network contracts.

### Parameter Tips

Owner Address: sets the owner of the LSD network being created.

Owner Permissions:
- Manage validators
- Change balancer account
- Adjust commission fee
- Adjust unbonding duration
- Adjust the minimum stake amount

Validator Address: `Vote Account` of the validator

### Rewards Distribution

Rewards distribution is crucial to project parties. Commission fee of users is set default as 10% and StaFi Stack fee is 10% of the project income. for example, if `100Token` rewards received from the chain, the distribution will be:

| Role | Amount(Token) | Formula |
|---------------|--------|-------|
|  Users        |  90 | 100*(1-0.1)  |
|  Project      |  9  | (100-90)*(1-0.1)  |
|  StaFi Stack  |  1  | 100-90-9  |

### Save all the information generated

The lsd network has a set of accounts, so you should save all the information which you will interact frequently with, such as Solana LSD App and Relay service.

- Owner address
- LST address
- Stack Contract address
- Stake Manager address

## Step2. Run relay service
[Follow this doc to run relay service](relay.html)

## Step3. Deploy your own LSD App
