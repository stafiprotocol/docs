title: Relay
---

Given the limitation of smart contracts, they are not self-executing, and require an external force to trigger their functions. Relay is a service to drive LSD network to properly process its own internal states, such as dealing with delegating, undelegating, distributing rewards and calculating the rate between LST and Sol. We introduce `era` concept to define how often in epochs the smart contract should be called.

*Security* is the our first priority when developing Stack, We are thrilled to say that the new era process is permissionless, showcasing the decentralized nature of the StaFi Sol LSD Stack, allowing anyone to trigger the new era process.

## Install
### Install build tools

Install `make`, `gcc` and `git`

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make gcc git build-essential
```

Install `go` by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to set your `$PATH` environment variable, for example:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget -O go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GO111MODULE=on' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc && . $HOME/.bashrc
go version
```

### Install relay service

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lsd-relay.git
cd solana-lsd-relay
make install
```
