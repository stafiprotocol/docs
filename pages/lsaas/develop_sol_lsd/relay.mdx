title: Relay

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'


Given the limitation of smart contracts, they are not self-executing, and require an external force to trigger their functions. Relay is a service to drive LSD network to properly process its own internal states, such as dealing with delegating, undelegating, distributing rewards and calculating the rate between LST and Sol. We introduce `era` concept to define how often in epochs the smart contract should be called.

*Security* is the our first priority when developing Stack, We are thrilled to say that the new era process is permissionless, showcasing the decentralized nature of the StaFi Sol LSD Stack, allowing anyone to trigger the new era process.

## Install
### Install build tools

Install `make`, `gcc` and `git`

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make gcc git build-essential
```

Install `go` by following the [official docs](https://golang.org/doc/install). Remember to set your `$PATH` environment variable, for example:

```bash
cd $HOME
wget -O go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.22.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export GOROOT=/usr/local/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export GO111MODULE=on' >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc && . $HOME/.bashrc
go version
```

### Install relay service

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stafiprotocol/solana-lsd-relay.git
cd solana-lsd-relay
make install
```

### Create and update config

```bash
$ cp config_start.example.toml config.toml
$ vim config.toml

Endpoint = "https://api.devnet.solana.com"
KeystorePath = "./keys/solana_keys.json"

LsdProgramID = "795MBfkwwtAX4fWiFqZcJK8D91P9tqqtiSRrSNhBvGzq"

StackAddress = "EpgquacesXp8h7nk9j5KcnzDVATFKLE995cuhj1hRbpR"
StakeManagerAddress = "6g8ziuefcXnmP1kmCXd7CGxdQrL59CkdnH9C6vQnQYkp" # entrusted mode if empty

## signers
FeePayerAccount = "ErCsmTQhM9qt17ce8XDTasKo76FEdg2scP2UX4VLxKDb"
```

## Commands

### Start relay service

```bash
$ solana-lsd-relay start --config config.toml --log_level info
```

**Config**

| config | description | example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| endpoint | rpc endpoint | |
| keystorePath | keystore file path | |
| lsdProgramID | lsd program id **provided by 61Lab** | |
| stackAddress | stack address **provided by 61Lab** |  |
| stakeManagerAddress | stake manager address<br/>created through **61Lab stack app**  |  |
| feePayerAccount | imported or generated account<br/>**must have enough funds to sign transactions**|  |

### Update Stake Manager Configs

`config_set_stakemanager.example.toml` will be used as a template file for updating settings.

```bash
$ cp config_set_stakemanager.example.toml config_set_stakemanager.toml
$ cat config_set_stakemanager.toml
```
```
Endpoint = "https://api.devnet.solana.com"
KeystorePath = "./keys/solana_keys.json"
# keystore will be omitted if ExportTx is enabled
ExportTx = false

LsdProgramID = "795MBfkwwtAX4fWiFqZcJK8D91P9tqqtiSRrSNhBvGzq"
StakeManagerAddress = "JAAGMA3nXSFq3QhSMC9Trkf5hneMGoGRLaGtEkmL1Nmj"

## signers
FeePayerAccount = "ErCsmTQhM9qt17ce8XDTasKo76FEdg2scP2UX4VLxKDb"
AdminAccount = "GgAy6GnqaPJUdGfCQGMgW2fGMMvmxc3E7a2oizFuCbhF"

# RateChangeLimit = 0
# UnbondingDuration = 8
# AddValidatorAddress   = ""
# RemoveValidatorAddress = ""
# MinStakeAmount = 0
# PlatformFeeCommission = 0
# NewBalancerAddress = ""
# NewAdminAddress = ""
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure ExportTx is set to true when working with multisig
</Callout>

Let's say we want to update `min stake amount` to 2000000, we update config `MinStakeAmount = 2000000`. Then execute bash command:

```bash
$ solana-lsd-relay stake-manager set-min-stake-amount 
load config success
stakeManager: JAAGMA3nXSFq3QhSMC9Trkf5hneMGoGRLaGtEkmL1Nmj
admin: GgAy6GnqaPJUdGfCQGMgW2fGMMvmxc3E7a2oizFuCbhF
feePayer: ErCsmTQhM9qt17ce8XDTasKo76FEdg2scP2UX4VLxKDb
minStakeAmount(lamports): 2000000
exportTx: true

check config info, then press (y/n) to continue:
y
set min stake amount tx(base58):
UhNyKks3vkbHAFx8Swc5vB21vHhCCZ57RLhXYQC73vE136ya72LyqQcGP5z25eqzfKRfD7EekXwDboaBLkbp2RaCnrg5wBLsjaomRyPAzX9tamcz3WronGF5idFuXhcfjCag14DUZgy4JRL9oaBt1CPj1yv6PhiEWnVCpdZMf2JX11DgjjU8oPnNHC5wPNzemyt8CWGRDHcH86djRuMfgFHfv5yFGZZBJXLvR5WSKvkzrmGi8K4tjb97FRv1m
Exiting.
```

You are able to update other configs in a same way. Available Commands:
- Add validator           
- Remove validator
- Set min stake amount
- Set platform fee commission
- Set rate change limit
- Set unbonding duration
- Transfer admin
- Transfer balancer
