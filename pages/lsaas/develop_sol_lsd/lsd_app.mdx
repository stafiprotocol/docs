Solana LSD App is a user interface where users can stake, unstake and get latest information about the project. As a convention in web3 all API users interact with are directly from the RPC configured in wallet, so the app is a pure DApp.

## Config your app

In normal case you do not need update IDL files, but if you modify the LSD program then you will update IDL files in `config/idl` folder.

- Change branding links and text here: `config/appConf/app.json`
- Set your network addresses for development environment here: `config/appConf/dev.json`
- Set your network addresses for production environment here: `config/appConf/prod.json`

## Customize theme

You can change color config in `tailwind.config.js`, each color has light & dark versions(i.e text1 & text1Dark).

## Build and deploy

Run `yarn build` or `yarn build:dev` to build your app, the static files will be placed in `out` folder. Upload those files to any static web hosting services you like.
